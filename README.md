# Step 1: Introduction to Python for Data Engineering

## Why Python for Data Engineering?  
Before we start coding, letâ€™s understand why Python is the top choice for Data Engineering:

âœ… **Ease of Use** â€“ Pythonâ€™s syntax is beginner-friendly but powerful.  
âœ… **Rich Ecosystem** â€“ Libraries like Pandas, NumPy, PySpark, and SQLAlchemy make data processing easy.  
âœ… **Scalability** â€“ Works well for small data tasks and scales up for big data processing.  
âœ… **Integration** â€“ Seamlessly connects with databases, APIs, and cloud platforms (AWS, GCP).

## Real-World Use Cases  

ðŸ”¹ **ETL Pipelines** â€“ Extracting data from APIs, transforming it using Pandas, and loading it into a database.  
ðŸ”¹ **Data Cleaning & Transformation** â€“ Handling missing values, standardizing formats, and aggregating data.  
ðŸ”¹ **Automation & Orchestration** â€“ Scheduling workflows using Apache Airflow.  
ðŸ”¹ **Big Data Processing** â€“ Using PySpark to process terabytes of data.
