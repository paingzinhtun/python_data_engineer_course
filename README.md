# Introduction to Python for Data Engineering

## 1.1 Overview of Data Engineering

Before diving into Python, it's important to understand what Data Engineering is and why it matters.

### What is Data Engineering?
Data Engineering is the process of **designing, building, and maintaining data pipelines** that enable businesses to **store, process, and analyze** large amounts of data efficiently.

### Role of a Data Engineer
A Data Engineer:
- Extracts and processes raw data from multiple sources
- Cleans and transforms data into a structured format
- Stores data in databases, data lakes, or warehouses
- Ensures data is accessible and optimized for analytics

### Data Engineer vs. Data Scientist
- **Data Engineers** build the data pipelines.
- **Data Scientists** analyze the data.

## 1.2 Why Python for Data Engineering?
Python is the preferred language for Data Engineering because:

âœ… **Easy to learn** â€“ Simple syntax and readability  
âœ… **Rich ecosystem** â€“ Libraries like Pandas, NumPy, PySpark, Airflow  
âœ… **Scalability** â€“ Works for small scripts and big data processing  
âœ… **Integration** â€“ Works with databases, APIs, cloud services, and more  

## 1.3 Key Libraries & Tools

| Category | Libraries & Tools |
|----------|-----------------|
| **Data Processing** | Pandas, NumPy |
| **Databases** | SQLAlchemy, psycopg2 (PostgreSQL), MySQL-connector |
